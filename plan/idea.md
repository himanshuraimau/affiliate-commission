### **Problem:**

Companies rely on affiliate partnerships but struggle to identify **the best partners** who bring in high-intent customers. Additionally, **managing affiliate payouts** becomes chaotic as partners scale.

### **Solution:**

Leverage **Payman** to build an **AI-driven affiliate management tool** that:

- **Finds and evaluates potential affiliates** based on performance metrics.
- **Sets up multi-accounts for tracking commissions** across different channels.

### **Example of Problem:**

- EcoEssentials, a sustainable product marketplace, works with 75 affiliate partners
- Their marketing manager Priya manually tracks conversions in spreadsheets
- Monthly commission calculations take 3 full days, with frequent errors
- They recently lost a top-performing affiliate who drove $27,000 in sales because of delayed and incorrect payments
- They can't effectively identify which affiliates bring the highest-value customers
- Your solution could create separate tracking accounts for each affiliate, automatically calculate commissions based on performance data, process instant payments via ACH or USDC, and provide analytics on which affiliates drive the most profitable customers
